# difforms

[![build status](https://github.com/paasim/difforms/workflows/check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paasim/difforms/actions)

The purpose of this project is to try to implement some basic constructs in differential geometry such as tangent vectors, vector fields, p-forms, exterior products and derivatives etc. in Haskell. The app itself does nothing, everything interesting is in `src/` and `test/`
