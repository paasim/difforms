# difforms
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paasim/difforms.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/paasim/difforms)

The purpose of this project is to try to implement some basic constructs in differential geometry such as tangent vectors, vector fields, p-forms, exterior products and derivatives etc. in Haskell. The app itself does nothing, everything interesting is in `src/` and `test/`
